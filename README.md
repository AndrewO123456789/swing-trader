## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Update It

You can update the `README.md` file anytime by:

1. Opening it in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
2. Editing the content
3. Saving and committing changes to GitHub (if synced)

Would you like me to generate the actual file content so you can copy-paste it directly into your folder or repo?
